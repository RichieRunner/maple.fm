# Maple.fm

**Maple.fm** is an open source web service built on the **Laravel framework** designed to allow players of the MMORPG MapleStory to display it's economical and Free Market information.

### Setup Maple.fm.
You can either clone or download the nightly version of Maple.fm via Github. Once downloaded, you will need to run the following commands in the root directory.

1. ```composer install```
2. ```composer update```
3. ```php artisan key:generate```

If the aforementioned commands fail, please append sudo (root privileges) to them.

As a part of the Laravel framework, Maple.fm uses it's .env file to handle some configurations. Please copy the current .env.example file and create a new .env file. This is automatically ignored thanks to .gitignore.
